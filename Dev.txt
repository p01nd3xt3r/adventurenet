New data file variable or hash addition checklist:
    Get-AVNConfig:
        getting data from data file for current player 
        from other players
        also make sure there's no calculated amount in the common variables that needs to be updated or added
    Add-AVNPlayer:
        creating data for new player and then writing to the new data file
    ConvertTo-AVNWriteData
        Add to writable format variable and then to Return line in the right spot to be sent to data file.

New function:
    AdventureNet.psd1:
        add to NestedModules and FunctionsToExport

New files:
    AdventureNet.psd1:
        If something that's being used by the functions, add to the included files section.

To Do:
Create specials content, including ones that can only be purchased with GIFs
Create project stages waves content
Just about all aesthetics
Create service ticket encounter content and put in a data file
Function for closing the season and prepping for the next one. Includes being able to show past season stats per player, so will need some new variable fields.
Test and debug current functions
Test gameplay, difficulty, rewards and scores, etc.
make sure project stages take into account appropriate deadlines.
Balance health increases and decreases:
    Maybe rolls, with certain combinations of work types, can have this effect
    Training increase team health? Perhaps purchasing GIFs in Teams.
    Maybe increases should only be from specials, whether purchased or found. That takes away some strategy, but it adds to the feeling of gambling.
    team health - Technical questions being answered? Seems like this would be a net 0, since answering the question reduces the answerer's health.
--->Need to test Close-AVNProjectStage waves. I added a check to make sure players can't do another wave of the same stage if they've already done one.
    To handle seasons, I created the close-avnseason function and need to design it. That way I'm not checking for things like what season it is every get-avnconfig. I'll just have it so that players can't do anything if all waves have been completed (and the season is over). I need to do a start-season function as well that wraps up all data files and resets get-date and the seasonfirstrun flag in the players' data files. Of course maybe the seasonclose function will do all this, and there doesn't need to be a seasonstart function at all.
    Could I allow players to share dice with others? Perhaps it's a special?
