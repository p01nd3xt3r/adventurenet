New data file variable or hash addition checklist:
    Get-AVNConfig:
        getting data from data file for current player 
        from other players
        also make sure there's no calculated amount in the common variables that needs to be updated or added
    Add-AVNPlayer:
        creating data for new player and then writing to the new data file
    ConvertTo-AVNWriteData
        Add to writable format variable and then to Return line in the right spot to be sent to data file.

New function:
    AdventureNet.psd1:
        add to NestedModules and FunctionsToExport

New files:

        If something that's being used by the functions, add to the included files section.

temp: 
add a note about how many turns left after taking a turn. maybe just show changes. you have used 1 turn and now have x turns left. you have lost 1 team health, and team health is now X. you have used one GIF and now have X. So maybe say all gains and losses when you get them.
What about a player having their own ability upgrades? Increasing GIF yield, for instance.
What about dice that add specials like bonus gifs?
more service tickets that can be taken care of by opportunities.
do I really need interrupt and preemptive specials? it feels like i have a whole lot of specials that i don't care to use. those should be coming in and going out more often
What if specials are permanent, but you have a limit, and you have to manage what you hang onto? maximum number of injections? maximum nimber of dice?
should later stages have harsher effects in health? Probably. Needs testing.
I can buy client health specials for cheaper than closing tech questions? Cp buying turns, buying client health...
vanity purchases: 
	change name
	set a color for your name for the scoreboard...
	perhaps the leader gets some special addition without having to buy it
	change player's own color scheme
	set a permanent global or title
add an easter egg or two...
maybe indicate who you are in the scoreboard
something to break up just going through service ticket? recharging?
*some other work thing than just service tickets? internal work? something that helps other players and gains kudos.
decrease chance of injection specials? need to see what subsequent stages are like; maybe change it based on the stage.
need to show what you gain or lose with project results.
losses giving training--after all, you learn as you fail.
stronger specials available per stage? double injections, etc. Injections of mixed types. specials that are already there have different strengths per stage.
Update readme about blocs.
make sure when service tickets are converted to tech questions that they are being removed from service ticket array for player.
if you are the player to defeat the final bloc of a project, let it tell you. Likewise, if a player defeated the last bloc, other players should find out at their next sign in. A "while you were away" section, perhaps.
Does invoke-signon change current penalty level before or after service tickets are converted into tech questions?
break up get-avngifs into specials and dice? or just specials? what about converting one into the other?
change ps current location line to show basic stats like turns and health and gifs? maybe have a command to turn this off and on, saving previous settings for when you turn it off
Make long text lines break according to best practice instead of in the middle of words. Enforce a manual width?
track how many times a player has logged in?
change prompt to have yellow as well? or blue. blue is also in our colors. yes, i need to include blues in the scheme.
if it's a special in your list of actions, show the effect/type?
specify help only for the added items in the list
say every time you lose or gain any stat
can buy random injection special (maybe for 15 gifs?)
