Function Close-AVNSeason {
    <# 
    Gather all data files.
    For each data file, invoke variables.
    Variables should include archival variables.
    Convert current variables into archival format and combine/replace old archival data.
        Do I combine and do an all-time archive, or do I just remove all but the most recent? Perhaps I can have an all-time calculations and a most-recent calculations.
    Write variables into an archived format, replacing current variables with default amounts. 
    Take into account it being the season first run, and project waves need to be created and all
